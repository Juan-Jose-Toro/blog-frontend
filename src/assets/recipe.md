## Recipe

1. For the veggies take: carrots, garlic, potatoes, salt, pepper and olive oil swirl
it all together.
2. Take the chicken thighs, pat them dry, add butter then season with salt, pepper.
3. Its interesting that if the veggies are put next to the chicken then they will
boil and absorb all the chicken juices coming out.
4. Put in the oven to low broil on the oven height level 1
for about an 35-40-60min (many sources disagree)
